# CPU Scheduler

## Algorithms: FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, SRTF, Priority

The CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulation Website is an interactive platform designed to simulate a variety of CPU scheduling algorithms, including First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Priority, and other popular algorithms.

This website features a user-friendly interface where users can input data such as the number of processes, arrival times, burst times, priorities, and time quantum. It visualizes the scheduling process and displays results in real-time, offering a clear understanding of how each algorithm works and its impact on system performance.

This simulation tool is ideal for students, educators, and professionals interested in learning about CPU scheduling algorithms and their practical applications. It provides a hands-on learning experience, allowing users to experiment with different scheduling algorithms and understand their effects on system performance.

The code for this simulation website is available on GitHub, making it easy to modify and adapt to specific needs and requirements. Designed to be user-friendly and customizable, it is accessible to users with varying levels of programming experience.
